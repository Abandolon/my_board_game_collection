# My Boardgame Collection

This web app was created to store details about my home boardgame collection.
Currently it does not take a user model, but further enhancements may include it.

This app uses an API call to [Board Game Atlas](https://www.boardgameatlas.com/api/docs)

# What I Learned

- manipulating json data from API calls
- analyzing documentation from new API service
- front end design

# Technology Used

- Ruby on Rails (Ruby: 2.6.1; Rails: 5.2.3)
- PostgreSQL
- Webpacker

- ES6

# Additional Features Planned
- [ ] Intergrate barcode scanner to make API call and retieve data
- [ ] Allow for multiple users
- [ ] Create a "Meet-up" feature to connect users in the same city who wish to play
- [ ] Connect to Amazon Affiliates to facilitate purchse of board games
- [ ] Connect to 3D Model website to offer my service to print board-game related objects
