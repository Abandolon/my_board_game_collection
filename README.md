#My Boardgame Collection

This web app was created to store details about my home boardgame collection.
Currently it does not take a user model, but further enhancements may include it.

This app uses an API call to [Board Game Atlas](https://www.boardgameatlas.com/api/docs)

#What I Learned

- manipulating json data from API calls
- analyzing documentation from new API service
- front end design

#Additional Features Planned

* Intergrate barcode scanner to make API call and retieve data
* Allow for multiple users
* Create a "Meet-up" feature to connect users in the same city who wish to play
* Connect to Amazon Affiliates to facilitate purchse of board games
* Connect to 3D Model website to offer my service to print board-game related objects

Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
